Time Complexity
sqrt = > O(logn)

Overall => O(logn)

Space Complexity
O(1)

Explanation:
For the function I used binary search algorithm where the time complexity is O(logn).
Within the binary search if my mid point value (mid**2) is smaller given number x and smaller then (mid+1)*(mid+1) then I am getting the squared root.
