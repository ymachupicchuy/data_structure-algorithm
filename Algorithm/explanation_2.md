Time Complexity
sqrt = > O(logn)

Overall => O(logn)

Space Complexity
O(1)

Explanation:
I also used binary search algorithm where the time complexity is O(logn).
One of the site (left, right) is always sorted. Therefore I am checking if the left or right half is sorted and applying binary search approach until I found my target.
