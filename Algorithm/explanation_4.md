Time Complexity
sort array = > O(n)


Overall => O(n)

Space Complexity
O(1)

Explanation:
I am sorting the array once and swaps the values unitl my mid reach the end.
This approach has a space complexity of O(1). 
The problem could be also solved with multiple loops but this approach was the for me the cleanest one but was not easy to understand for the first time.
