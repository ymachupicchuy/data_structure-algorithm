Time Complexity
add, deleteNode, get, set = > O(1)

Overall => O(1)

Space Complexity
O(1)

Explanation:
I used the Doubly Linked list and a dictionary to create the LRU Cache. I set the head and tail as dummy between it I have created my LRU cache

Accessing the key over the dictionary the time complexity is O(1) and adding and deleting a Node from a Doubly Linked List is also O(1)
