# Data Structure & Algorithm

## Projects

### Data Structures

The highlights of these projects was problmes such as LRU Cache, Private Blockchain, File Recursion, Active Directory and Huffman-Tree.
The challenge was it datastructures such as Queue, Stack, LinkedList, Priority Queue and Doubly Linked List taking into account the time complexities. 
For each problems 3 tests was provided

## Algorithm
Problems such autocompleter, unsorted integer, routing trie.
The interesting part of this work was to use a trie (prefix trie) for the autocompleter and how it works. 
Also, how faster binary search is for sorted arrays.


## RoutePlanner 
This is my favorite algorithm by so far to find the shortest path instead of using just Dijktra Algorithm which is know as A* algorithm.
It is the algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
Unfortunately Google knews it earlier then most of the people like me. Don't underestimate it. 
It is a beautiful algorithm and extremely powerful
